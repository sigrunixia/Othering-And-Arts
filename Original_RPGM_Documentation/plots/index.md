# Plotting Structures

RPG Manager is a tool that simplify Storytellers' life in plotting a [campaign](../components/campaign.md). In many 
years as a Storyteller, I have found two ways of creating my plots with two things in mind: quality of game and speed 
in creating them.

The two structures I have adopted to write my [campaigns](../components/campaign.md), 
[adventures](../components/adventure.md), [acts](../components/act.md) and [sessions](../components/session.md)
is based on the idea that a story (_or a plot in the case of role playing games_) should never be linear, as
linearity breeds boredom. Moreover, I believe that we put too much efforts in creating "_plot hooks_", while we
should be driving "**needs and desires**" in our players to let their [characters](../components/character.md) to
embark in an adventure.

For these reasons I focussed on storytelling techniques coming from writing and scriptwriting, but that are simple
enough not to slow me down when writing them. The two structures are very similar, as they divide every story in four
parts:
- feel of a need
- research for the goal
- reaching of the goal paying a heavy price
- return to the world they know being able to change it

These four parts make the player feel on a rollercoaster of emotions, which drive the excitment of the game.

The two structures I decided to implement in RPG Manager are the [ABT](abt.md) and [Story Circle](storycircle.md)
structures. They are very similar, but while the [ABT](abt.md) is very high level, the [Story Circle](storycircle.md)
allows to dig a bit deeper in how to plot [campaigns](../components/campaign.md), 
[adventures](../components/adventure.md), [acts](../components/act.md) and [sessions](../components/session.md)
