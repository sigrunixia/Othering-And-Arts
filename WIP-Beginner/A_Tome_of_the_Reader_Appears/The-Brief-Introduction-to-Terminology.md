# The Brief Introduction to Terminology

> The party returns to a library not unlike the one they came from. Before them, a book lays open. A nearby mirror shimmers and becomes a doorway to [**RPG Manager Quick Settings**](RPG-Manager-Quick-Settings.md)

RPG Manager uses a **Hierarchy** to separate and organize the details of a campaign plot. This organization system takes familiar features from theatre, film, and writing, and divides it up into easy-to-implement TBA

The structure is fixed and cannot be customised.

## The Hierarchy

> **Campaign** > **Adventures** > **Acts** > **Scenes**

A **Campaign** is an overarching plot which does not involve the player characters directly.

> There can be only one Campaign per Campaign. There can be many Campaigns per vault.

An **Adventure** is self-contained story arcs that intersect the campaign's main plot.

>There can be multiple adventures in a campaign. You might equate them to a season in a television show.

An **Act** is a further branching of an adventure and provides a more organized way to manage the adventure's arc. Apart form being a logical branch of an adventure, an act has its own plot that supports the campaign's overarching plot.

> There can be multiple acts in an adventure. These would be the episodes in the season of the television show.

A **Scene** is the smallest element in the plotting phase, and identifies a moment in a game in which the player characters are required to do something. Consider, for example, a combat, or meeting a non-player character, or climbing a wall to reach something they need: these are all examples of scenes.

> There can be multiple scenes in an act. These would be equivalent to long moments of dialogue or action between transitions or commercial breaks in an episode of a television show.

A **Session** is the in-real-life game session you and your players will play. It technically is not a part of the hierarchy of plotting, but is used to help connect external game notes to in character, in-game events. It also acts as a container for grouping what Scenes happen in a session.

## The Elements

Where the **Hierarchy** and Sessions contain the plotting organization structure and overall story, the **Elements** contain the individuals, places, occasions, and other Worldbuilding items that help the campaign come to life.

A **Character** or **Player Character** is the character of a **Player**.
