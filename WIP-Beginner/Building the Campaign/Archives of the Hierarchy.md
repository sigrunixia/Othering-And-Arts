## What is a Campaign?
A campaign is a story that does not revolve the player characters. It is an unfinished story with which the player characters will interact, but the campaign plot itself will move on with, or without, the interaction of the player characters.

For example, if the players decide to spend weeks upon weeks at a hip, popular resort at Xambu-3 while the cataclysmic armies of Lairn the Furious ravage star system, including the planet that the players needed to go to next for their quest, is the campaign suddenly over? Of course not, but this is something that can happen in prebuilt, highly pre-planned games. 

> **Seed**: "Doesn't the game just.. stop? Like the players party forever at the resort."
> **Leaf**: "Yeah, it's the game master who decides these things. I played Hoard of the Dragon Queen. We didn't leave the tavern for a month. The world didn't change."


"The game master who decides these things." Oh really? You truly believe that? We'll see. Carrying on now. Do keep up, will you?

Now, RPG Manager (RPGM) is built to help the storyteller let the players do what they want (even at the cost of a whole universe if need be), and let their actions shape the course of the story. While at the same time leaving you as the storyteller the ability to be adaptable, keeping the players on their toes, and allowing the story to push back with consequences. 

Enough talking now. How about we do some practical work. Are you ready Seed, Leaf, Tree, and Cactus? Let's Make A Campaign!
