# Designing an Act

Twilight falls as the party of flora readers find their way back onto the main road that came from [**Creating an Adventure**](Creating%20an%20Adventure.md). Now, they find themselves at a crossroads. 

> **Seed**: We can't go back that way. That angry Signore Fenice will burn us alive.
> **Tree**: Yeah. But which of these other ways?
> **Cactus**: I bet that Librarian knows.
> **Herb**: The one who sticks his nose up at us? Fat chance. 
> **Seed**: Dude.. that's not cool. He has no nose and its wrong to pick on someone for something they have no control over.
> **Herb**: Says the seedling who pissed off our instructor.

"Excuse me fine folk. You need any assistance?"

> Herb twirled around. "Hey, we're busy talk- Holy Galdalf?!"

The elder chuckled as he adjusted the brim of his hat. "Apologies to startle you my little friends. You are all quite far from the Shire and are never going to make it on time at this rate. Allow me to provide you a lift but do mind the fireworks in back, they are quite touchy."
