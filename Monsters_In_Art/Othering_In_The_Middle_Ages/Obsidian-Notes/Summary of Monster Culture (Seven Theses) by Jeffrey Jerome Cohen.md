The monster is frequently a “disturbing hybrid” that defies categorization––its hybridity rebels against nature. And though there are fictional monsters, real people can become monsters too. So, in order to bring “freaks” under control, those who abide by the standard codes of the day ascribe monstrous identities to those who do not. Anxiety is what breeds monsters and defines their existence. By locating the origin of monsters, Cohen strives to reveal our culture’s values and tendencies. This week, please read the attached article -Monster Culture (Seven Theses) by J.J. Cohen, then break down and clarify in your own words what the seven theses are articulating.* 

The first thesis says that “__the monster’s body is a cultural body__” that is born at metaphoric crossroads of a cultural moment. It embodies uncertainty, and appears at a point of indecision that can lead to many other places. Cohen says that the “monster inhabits the gap between the time of upheaval that created it and the moment which  it is to received to be born again” the latter probably meaning when it is to be reinterpreted in a new historical, social, and cultural context. The monster’s body incorporates fear, desire, anxiety, and fantasy, which give them life and independence.

The second thesis, “__The Monster Always Escapes__” says that while the damage caused by the monster remains, the monster itself vanishes only to reappear somewhere else–in another place or time. No matter how many times we kill the monster, it reappears to haunt us, to draw attention to itself, to make us examine it within the contemporary social, cultural, and literary historical context. Cohen illustrates the idea by describing the myth of the vampire that reoccurs in history but transforming each time by reflecting the specific contemporary issue of the time it in which it reappears.  The transgressive and compelling sexuality in the original Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” reborns as fascism and desire that causes plague and bodily corruption in “Nosferatu,” then transforms again to conjoin itself with homosexuality in Anne Rice’s “Interview with a Vampire.” In each of these stories the vampire returns but in different clothing to be read against contemporary social movement or a specific historically defining event. In this sense, the monster is transcultural and transtemporal, whose appearance and interpretation are bound in a double act of construction and reconstitution. The monster is significant because whenever it reemerges, it warns us of an important social and cultural phenomenon that needs to be addressed.

The third thesis, “The Monster is the Harbinger of Category Crisis,” describes the monster’s very nature to defy categorization, scientific laws, and rational order. For example, the alien in Ridley Scott’s movie defies every natural law of evolution; it is all bivalve, crustacean, reptilian, and humanoid. The monster is a disturbing hybrid with an externally incoherent body that resist attempts to be included in any systematic structuration. The monster, which appears at times of crisis, threatens to smash distinctions, problematizes the clash of extremes, questions the black and white binary mode of thinking, demands a radical rethinking of boundary and normality, and resists classification built on hierarchy. This particular power has coursed through the monster’s blood from classical times, undermining the attempts of Aristotle and other philosophers to incorporate the monstrous races into a coherent order. The monster then always escapes back to its original habitation, which is at the conceptual margins of the world. The monstrous offers an escape and invites us to explore new and interconnected methods of perceiving the world.  The monster, too large to be encapsulated in any conceptual term, is a revolution in the very logic of meaning.

The fourth thesis, “The Monster Dwells at the Gates of Difference,” explains that the monster is difference made flesh that comes to dwell among us. It represents the “Other,” the “Outside,” from what is culturally, politically, racially, economically, sexually normative. This concept that cultural difference is a monstrous aberration is familiar; it is presented in the Bible, where aboriginal inhabitants of Canaan are envisioned as menacing giants to justify the Hebrew colonization of the Promised Land. Such representation of anterior culture as monstrous justifies extermination of the monstrous by rendering the act heroic. In medieval France, the crusades were celebrated for transforming Muslims into demonic caricatures, making it admissible the annexation of the East by the West. In the US, Native Americans were presented as unredeemable savages and made colonization justified by Manifest Destiny. Jews were targeted for xenophobic misrepresentation when communities wanted to be homogeneous and monolithic. Political or ideological difference has been a catalyst to monstrous representation. Political figures suddenly out of favor are demonized and historically dictated as monsters. They move between monster and man, having incoherent bodies, always in peril of disaggregation. In this context, history itself becomes a monster–defeaturing and self-deconstructive. Violation of sexual taboos and transgression of gender roles are also frequent catalysts for monstrous representation. Difference in race is also frequently represented as monstrous. The dark skin color of Ethiopians, terrifying and malformed as it appeared, were symptomatic of sinfulness, as it was associated with fires of hell and demonic provenance. This such demonization justified policies of exclusion and enslavement. In this thesis, the “other” culture is fragmented then recombined to assemble a monster that claims an independent identity. The monster seeks out its creators to bear witness to the fact that it could have been constructed nonmonstrously.

In the fifth thesis “The Monster Policies the Borders of the Possible,” the monster stands as a warning against exploring the unknown. Curiosity is punished; individuals who step outside accepted boundaries risk attack by the monstrous or become monsters themselves. Lycaon, the first werewolf in Western literature, undergoes lupine metamorphosis when he violates host-guest relationship and rebels against Jupiter. The borders and threats act to limit women and validate hierarchy. The monster is transgressive, breaks taboo that it has to be destroyed, but it keeps returning again.

In the sixth thesis “Fear of the Monster is Really a Kind of Desire” presents monster has an attractive force that tempts people into forbidden practices and taboo. They are both terrifying and evocative of fantasies. This accounts for the monster’s continued cultural popularity. We envy the monster’s freedom which allows us to safely express our fantasies of aggression, domination, and inversion. The monster enables formation of all kinds of identities through safe expression.

The seventh thesis “The Monster Stands at the Threshold…of Becoming” brings attention to the fact that we are the creators of monsters. They make us question why we have created them; how we perceive the world, how we have misinterpreted so that we can reevaluate cultural assumptions about the different (race, gender, sexuality. etc.).
