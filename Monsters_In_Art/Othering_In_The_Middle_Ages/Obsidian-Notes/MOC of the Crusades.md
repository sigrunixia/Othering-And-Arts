There are many translations of texts about the First Crusade. Dana C. Munro ["Urban and the Crusaders", *Translations and Reprints from the Original Sources of European History*, Vol 1:2, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1895)] and August. C. Krey, [*The First Crusade: The Accounts of Eyewitnesses and Participants*, (Princeton: 1921)] both translated selections of crusader sources organized around events.

## The Fifth and Later Crusades

After the Fourth Crusade, the nature of the movement changed. Never again was there a general multinational crusade directed at the Holy Land. The experiences of 1187-92 had shown that Egypt was the base of Muslim power, and so expeditions were directed there. It would be a mistake to see the end of crusading fervour however. During the thirteenth century there were eight large expeditions, as well as other manifestations of crusading ideas. None of these expeditions could avoid the effects of the rise of the Mongols and Mamelukes in the Middle East - where armies increased in size and made the small Western units meaningless. The eight thirteenth-century expeditions were:

1. 1218, Andrew of Hungary's Crusade
2. 1218-21, __The Fifth Crusade__
3. 1228-29, Frederick II's Crusade
4. 1239, Thibaut of Navarre's Crusade
5. 1240-41, Richard of Cornwall's Crusade
6. 1248-54, __The Sixth Crusade__ - St. Louis's Crusade
