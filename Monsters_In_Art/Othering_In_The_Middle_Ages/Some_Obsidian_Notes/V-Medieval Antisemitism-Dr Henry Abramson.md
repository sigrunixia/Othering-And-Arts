Can be broken down into 4 basic periods. It adapts to the nature of society it lives in.

Ancient Xenophobia is "fear of strangers" period. However, everyone had fear of one another at this point in time, and so it was not specifically anti-semitic.

Early Christian Period is when Christianity begins to splinter from Judaism and so there are normal birth pangs and breakaway pangs. Where the new religion tries to show itself as the better one than the older one.

Modern Antisemitism was coined in the 19th century. Religion is no longer relevant. It is purely secular. There are many figures showing entities and animals reaching around the world showing how "jews have the power over the world."

Medieval Antisemitism is still very nasty.

In the 12th's century you see the development of the theme of ritual murder as a scapegoat reason for missing children. The thought was Jews were the original killers of Jesus, and thus they would want to kill jesus again, vicariously. So they would re-enact the crucifiction through ritual murder of children.

Blood Libel is the argument is that jews not only want to recrucify a child, but they also want to take his blood. There was a thought that Jews smelled bad and only Christian blood got rid of the smell. The blood was considered an aphrodesiac. Rumor had it that jewish men menstruated, and so needed christian blood to replenish iron. Arguments were used that the blood was used at the passover. Note, that the passover happen at the same time as Easter.

Desecration of the host is the argument that Jews wanted to tortue the wafer (the host) because they also want to torture the body of christ.

The Judensau is the evolution/devolution of a judicial device to punish minor offenders with caricatures drawn of them.

"For example, an image and it has many of the common elements in the Judensaur. You can see that there are four Jews involved in various activities. Once again right in the center of the backs of the Jews you see the ruel, the badge. You can see the Judenhood. You can see them inspecting the backside and anuses of the sow and drinking its milk [directly from the teet] and so on."

"Here in this image which is more typical. You see the elements of the devil being involved. You see on the right-hand side the devil with his horns, also wearing the ruel is actively assisting Jews in eating the excreement from the pig. I see theres a woman in the background and she's also holding a ram's head which we saw in a different image earlier for similar reasons though. And.. on the top of theres a victim of the blood libel."
