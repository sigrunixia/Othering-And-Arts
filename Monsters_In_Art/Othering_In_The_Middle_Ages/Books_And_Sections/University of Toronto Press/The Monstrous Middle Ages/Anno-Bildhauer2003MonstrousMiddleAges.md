# Bildhauer - 2003 - The Monstrous Middle Ages

*Import date*:: 2022-10-30
*Bildhauer2003MonstrousMiddleAges*


> [!EXAMPLE] Abstract
>
> he figure of the monster in medieval culture functions as a vehicle for a range of intellectual and spiritual inquiries, from questions of language and representation to issues of moral, theological, and cultural value. Monstrosity is bound up with questions of body image and deformity, nature and knowledge, hybridity and horror. To explore a culture's attitudes to the monstrous is to comprehend one of its most important symbolic tools.

> [!important] Question and Followups
> As a metaphor for evil, the night has been widely applied. People, places and moods have all been so called, but if there is one epoch that stands out for its popular association with darkness, then it is the medieval period.
>
>> Why is there an association with evil? I have long suspected it is due to a biological fear or wariness of the [[dark]]. Beyond what lies in the dark, we have seen in history discrimination against those with darker skin even amongst those within the same in-groups.

> [!important] Question and Followups
> a key question is the extent to which the night-time was feared and demonized in the Middle Ages. Was this because the night was considered the time for monstrosity, or did night itself become anthropomorphized into a temporal monstrosity?

> [!summary] Summary
> Before the electrification of Europe, the night deprived people of one of their most vital senses. Plunged into darkness, they became more ignorant of the world around them. At a practical level, serious accidents were a regular feature of life. Coroners' records tell the tales of those who died during the night, falling into ditches, downstairs or, like St Anselm, down cisterns when trying to answer a night-time call of nature.3
>
>> Notice how these examples are in a more urban and equivalent suburban context.

> [!important] Question and Followups
> The candles and fires that were the only means of illuminating the night were a fire hazard, and again coroners' records reveal the number of night-time deaths resulting from unattended candles.4 Intentional death and misery could also flourish under the cloak of darkness in the form of ambushes and the cases of crime and disorder discussed below.
>
>> These would be more prevalent in urban and populous areas as well. Was the same fear and myth prevalent in the equivalent of rural?

> In Genesis, the newly created world is described as formless, empty and covered in darkness. To this, God gave light and separated night from day. Night, therefore, was natural and part of the divine order: its purpose was to mark seasons, days and years; but it was light that 'was good'

> [!important] Question and Followups
> In his City of God, St Augustine of Hippo (AD 354-430) used the creation of night and day as an interpretative tool in his discussion of the division of angels: the rebel angels were cast down into the shadows whereas 'the good angels are rightly called light'. With regard to believers, Augustine quoted the words of the apostle Paul: 'you are all sons of light, and sons of the day; we do not belong to night and darkness'.

> [!example] Analysis
> By the late Middle Ages, there was a whole range of punishments -burning, freezing, dismemberment -that scribes could draw upon. But language's limited abilities to express these horrors demanded the use of darkness as an important narrative device
>
>> It sounds like the night and darkness was added in because a desensitization effect was happening with the existing punishments. In essence, torture was not scary enough then as it is not scary enough now.

> [!summary] Summary
> Equally symbolic is the idea that purgatorial souls are black as sin. Metaphorically these had been 'in the dark' on earth, since their bodies had engaged in non­ Christian behaviour and had turned their backs on the 'light' that is Christ. In purgatory,that light is nowbeing withheld from them.

> [!summary] Summary

> [!important] Question and Followups
> By the late Middle Ages, Church authorities also believed that the night was populated with cannibalistic night-witches. Until the thirteenth century, the belief in night-witches, and in the more benign spirits known as 'ladies of the night', was merely denounced as pagan by the Church, which saw the believers as deluded. During the thirteenth century, how­ ever, attitudes began to change: ladies of the night were no longer beautiful, or merely apparitions, but demons who roamed the earth in human guise; night-witches were no longer dismissed as pagan beliefs, but considered evidence of humans consorting with demons.

>> Because what is more dangerous than a woman? A woman going out at night, unwatched.
>
> [(p. 153)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43BPWH4H?page=153&annotation=Y64SF3RB)

> [!example] Analysis
> Church authorities paint a picture of women, seemingly ordinary and law­ abiding by day, mutating into 'wicked women' at night. Whether they were fooling themselves or actively consorting with devils, these women would remain bodily asleep in bed, but were able to fly through the night for nefarious ends. By this later period, too, demons were believed to take on the likeness of ordinary people at night in order to discredit them by engaging in dishonourable deeds. Symbolically, therefore, the night was a time when people, and women in particular, were in danger of being transformed or tricked into immorality.
>
>> Night time provides a cloak from societies' eyes. Thus the Church progressively viewed women as innately wicked and evil, but manageable when under the purview of the light of god (men).

> [!summary] Summary
> One such event was the feast of Candlemas (2 February), where candles performed an important physical and metaphorical role in marking the retreating darkness. As Ronald Hutton has noted, 'the spectacle of light growing against the shadows was also an appropriate one with which to open the month which drove the darkness from the afternoon and (usually) restored the flowers and buds to England' .31 Parishioners could take candles from the ceremony to protect themselves in the coming year. The action of lighting the candles in times of fear and crisis served to empower people against all manner of night-time terrors.

> [!important] Question and Followups
> Far from wanting to encourage these night-time activities, medieval town governments strove to drive a wedge between the two time zones and to make the night a 'no-go' area. Their bid at controlling the night used a combination of suppression, super­ vision and punishment; it was underpinned by an ideology that characterized the night as the location of malevolence.

> [!important] Question and Followups
> The most powerful and direct weapon to prevent night-time activity was the curfew, designed to shut the city down. This was a widespread policy throughout Europe, and the curfew bell became a familiar instrument of control. The bell in the Sorbonne rang at 9 o'clock, and police regulations in France threatened to impose fines on anyone out on the streets without a light after the last bell. The fine was 10 sous in 1394 (the price of 60 loaves of bread weighing 18 ounces).

> [!example] Analysis
> A far greater worry for authorities, especially in Italian city­ states, was sodomy, which had become increasingly demonized from the late thirteenth century. Indeed, some of the leniency shown towards prostitution in continental Europe was based on the desire to lure men away from same-sex practices.

> Nevertheless, these actions had the positive effect of strengthening communal bonds: the actions of Christian festivals to banish the night engendered a sense of belonging from a shared fear.

This feat had been achieved by the presence on the island of an awful monster - a [[Péist]] - which God ([[YWHW]]) had sent to ward off any unwelcome visitors, and Raphael instructed Senan that he should now cast the monster out from the island so that it should not annoy the members of the new community.

At Senan's words the monster immediately left the island and went to Dubloch of Sliab Collain.

> [!summary] Summary
> The depiction of dragons and other mythical beasts on coats of arms, as opposed to banners and standards, seems to have started in France and Germany in the late fourteenth century, and it is likely that these invocations of the strength and energy of monsters have a common root in the essential idea of combat between the saint and the dragon.

> [!example] Analysis
> These fearsome creatures were understood to be almost impossible to defeat: the knight who compared himself to a dragon through his heraldic device was often -understood, via back-formation of legends, to have defeated such a creature, or to be descended from someone who had performedsuch a feat, and perhaps in consequence to have absorbed some of the monstrous strength.

>> Another incidence of both mantling as well as protecting. Holding the symbol of the dragon to channel its representation of strength and power (May I persevere in battle with the strength of the wyrm), and a [[../../../../10%20Zettelkasten/12%20Baby%20Zettel/Apotropaic.md]] function of protecting the knight's flesh from harm

> [(p. 212)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43BPWH4H?page=212&annotation=DIJQIBK6)

> [!example] Analysis
> The dragon's main function in combat narratives was to act as a foil to the [[valour]] of its human antagonist, and in the same way an encounter with such a creature throws the very saintly power of the saint into relief.

>> Valour came later, in the 14th century. Before then, the dragon served as the ultimate test for the human as a test of bravery, of duty, loyalty, and sacrifice, as described in [[Beowulf]].

> [!example] Analysis
> The motif of the saint overcoming the monster could perhaps be understood as a heightened version of this topos: on one level we can see that saints are the best of people and that monsters are the worst of animals, and the inevitable victory of the saint is a reimposition of the 'natural' order, with 'good' humans firmly sited at the top of the hierarchy of creation.
>
>> To simplify, the problem that humans have with monsters in these stories, is that monsters usually display a sentience or a display of will that goes outside the ordained order. We've explored the social order aspects before, but to take it a notch further, the monster goes above what humans deem the natural order, ranging from "I do not think you should exist" to "You can't exist!"

> [!important] Question and Followups
> This level of popularity is almost certainly grounded in the ability of dragons to act as vehicles of meaning: these creatures are essentially formable. No one is quite sure what they look like, how they behave or where they live, but one thing is clear: they are almost invariably associated with evil and can be usefully set up in opposition to a properly well­behaved human. This quality of otherness is often demonstrated through a grotesque appearance, which borrows elements from other potentially fearsome beasts (notably snakes, bats, bears and dogs), and is frequently topped off by pestilential or fiery breath.

> [!example] Analysis
> Of greater interest, however, is the obvious use of romantic devices: the day-long battle of knight and dragon, let alone the invocation of King Arthur himself, surely indicates that this narrative is constructed to call on the myth of medieval chivalry and to demonstrate that the power of sanctity, shielded only by the sign of the cross, outweighs the bravest armed and armoured knight.

> [!example] Analysis
> Meanwhile, [[St Simeon Stylites]]'s dragon is an object of fear but is not explicitly destructive. This creature too is shown to be redeemed, as it abases itself before the saint and worships at the gate of the monastery, but again it ultimately returns to its lair in the world beyond the settlement.

>> This could also be a metaphor for the sinner or the pagan or other outcast who has not yet accepted the "teachings of Christ into their heart" but they are not turned away so long as they are respectful of the lord.

> [!example] Analysis
> As with the legends of Sts Senan, Simeon Stylites and Marcellus, the Blessed Ammon, and arguably St Matthew , this story of St Philip and the dragon identifies wilderness as the natural habitat of monsters: they either come from it or are made to return to it.

> It seems that the saint was understood to act as an embodiment of urban civilization, overcoming and containing the threat of the untamed natural world beyond as he leads the wounded dragon into the town before ceremonially killing it.

> Despite this clear link between the Devil and the dragon, it is clear that monsters can also act as agents of God. St Senan's monster is one example; another occurs in the Golden Legend 'Life of St Benedict'.

> [!summary] Summary
> Hardly had the monk got outside the gate when he met with a dragon, which opened its maw and wanted to devour him. The monk cried out to some of the brothers who were nearby: 'Hurry, hurry, this dragon wants to eat me!' They ran up but saw no dragon, and led the trembling terrified brother back to the monastery, where he was quick to promise that he would never leave again.
