# Barebones Puppets 2022

## Summary of the Show

Before the show officially began, the crows, the witches, fairies, and other wonders meandered through the sitting crowd. It was already night fall, and they were really sneaky; scaring people. The crows are on padded feet, and the witches and fairies on stilts. Only one "good" fairy existed, who was earthbound, armed with only one small wand with a light at the end. Eventually one of the crows took it and there was no light in the darkness.

If someone took a cell phone out, the crows rushed for it. Shiny!

### Show Start

The trees move through the forest. Then, a leaf falls. The trees stop, and they begin to take root. Autumn is upon them.

A squirrel runs along the ground with acorns stuffed in it's cheeks. A great, big eye appears before it and it freezes, afraid. The crows are upon it. The eye disappears as the crows feast.

A family of the people of the First Nations (One of the Dakota tribes) takes a walk through this forest, but tragedy strikes and the spirit of Death has arrived for one of the elders.

### Two Journeys

From here, the show splits off. We see two journeys; the living and the dead.

For the journey of the dead elder, the emanation of death and the procession guide the elder on the journey to the next stage of their journey in post-life. Different tribes have different beliefs. Some believe they return to a spirit form, some to to the earth, some in reincarnation, some to an underworld and afterlife. This procession leaves me to think this show is portraying the underworld and afterlife version, while also portraying the overarching themes about the close extinction of the tribal nations. I'll need more time to analyze the details of the characters chosen.

At the same time, the journey of those who remain- the living as the bear. Yet not is all well for the living. The bear looks for fish and there are none. While wandering, it collapses and falls asleep, where it dreams of catching fish. In its dream, it catches  the fish. As it dreams, it dies, and the winged serpents of the earth feast on the remains of the bear.

### Reunited

In death, they people are united with the ones they cared for. Back in the plane of the living, the living remember the dead and carry them forward.

*The audience was encouraged over a period of five minutes to remember their dead and call out their names.*

Afterwards, small birds of light filled the darkness and they multiplied, multiplied, until they came together and formed the head and wings of a bird, possibly a [thunderbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbird_(mythology)).

## Disco Time

Everything ended with a disco dance.
