Campaign

# Campaign Component

The `campaign` is the overarching element of every story. The `campaign` is used to start the world building 
process to create the world and the plot in which the player character will live.

In a [structured plotting](../plots/index.md) approach, a `campaign` is a story that does not involve the player
characters. It is an unfinished story with which the player characters will interact, but the `campaign` plot itself
will move on with or without the interaction of the player characters.

A `campaign` is the starting point for each [adventure](adventure.md) in it, they should explore elements of the 
campaign. In a [structured plotting](../plots/index.md) approach, the `campaign` plot should help the Storytellers
identify moments in which adventures can be created. This is especially important in understanding **why** the 
player characters should be interested in playing an [adventure](adventure.md). Many call these the "_plot hooks_"
or "_adventure hook_".
