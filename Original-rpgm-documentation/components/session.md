Session

# Session Component

A `session` is a in-real-life game session your players will play. In a [structured plotting](../plots/index.md) 
approach, `sessions` collect [scenes](scene.md) the player characters will live.

It is important to understand that a `session` is not a plotting `component`, it is just a container of already 
plotted [scenes](scene.md) organised to create the best engagement with the players.
