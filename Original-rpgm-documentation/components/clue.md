Clue

# Clue Component

A `clue` is an object in the [campaign](campaign.md) which holds some important relevance for the plot. The `clues` 
generally help advancing the story and give information to the player characters. `Clues` are _generally_ related to
[events](event.md), [locations](location.md) and [non-player characters](non-player-character.md).

RPG Manger offers a way of organising `clues` through its [subplot components](subplot.md)
