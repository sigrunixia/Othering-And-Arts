Act

# Act Component

An `act` is a segment of an [adventure](adventure.md) and it sould focus on a specific moment in the story of the
[adventure](adventure.md). In a [structured plotting](../plots/index.md) approach, each `act` should identify one of
the four moments in an [adventure](adventure.md):
- Discover of the need
- Quest to fulfil the need
- Reach of the initial result
- Change and complete the [adventure](adventure.md)

Each `act` should contain one or more [scenes](scene.md).

Ideally an act should be run in a single [session](session.md)
