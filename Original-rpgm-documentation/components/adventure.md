Adventure

# Adventure Component

An `adventure` is a standalone story arc in a [campaign](campaign.md). The `adventure` must have a `hook` to make sure
the player characters embark in it, but should have a beginning, a middle part and an end. In a 
[structured plotting](../plots/index.md) approach, these four parts (hook, beginning, middle, end) should be
identified by four separate [acts](act.md).
