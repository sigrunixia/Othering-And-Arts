# Location Component

A `location` is a physical place in the world the [player characters](character.md) are living in. RPG Manager does not 
discriminate  or require a specific size, as it can be as big as a country, or as small as a drawer. `Locations` are 
where the [player characters](character.md) will live their stories, and while not all `locations` are worth
a `component`, but those with more interest, or the ones that are recurring should.

A `location` can contain multiple sub-locations. These sub-locations are nothing more than another `location component`
in a specific relation with the parent one. In this way, you can organise your locations hierarchically.
