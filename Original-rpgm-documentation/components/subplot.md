Subplot

# Subplot Component

A `subplot` is a plot which runs inside the main campaign which helps keeping track of some specific objectives and
help organising [events](event.md) and [clues](clue.md) in a way to simplify the Storyteller's life.

A `subplot` is not a plot `component`, even if it can contain a [structured plotting](../plots/index.md) approach, as it
is not a main [adventure](adventure.md). It simply identifies sub-stories which can be played in multiple moments 
of [adventures](adventure.md) and [acts](act.md).

The reason for the `subplot` to exist is to help the Storyteller organising their notes and correlate different story
arcs spanning multiple [adventures](adventure.md).
