duration

# duration

The duration is a key that identifies for how long the [scene](../../components/scene.md) has been played during a 
[session](../../components/session.md)

This value is valid if you use a [structured plotting](../plots/index.md) approach in conjunction with the
[Scene Analyser](../../analyser/index.md).

**Please Note**: this value is automatically overwritten every time you use the timer to keep track of a
[scene](../../components/scene.md) duration. Is should not be manually edited 

Accepted Values:
- number of seconds the scene has been played for
