Scene Analyser

# Scene Analyser

The `Scene Analyser` is an automation tool that helps you plotting better [acts](../components/act.md) by analysing
the [scenes](../components/scene.md) in the [act](../components/act.md) and evaluating their balance, the 
expected duration of the act and various other data points.

## Requirements

For the `Scene Analyser` to do its job, there are a few things you need to do. First and foremost you need to
activate the `Scene Analyser` in the settings of RPG Manager. This will enable the analyser to run its job and
to show you all the fields you need to give the analyser enough information to tell you how well balanced
your [acts](../components/act.md) or [sessions](../components/session.md) are.

In order to make the `Scene Analyser` work its magic, you need to use the [scenes](../components/scene.md) properly,
adding at least two information for each scene:
- [Scene Type](scenetypes.md)
- [Scene Excitement](sceneexcitement.md)

These two elements give the `Scene Analyser` enough information to report on the balance of the 
[scenes](../components/scene.md) in your [acts](../components/act.md) or [sessions](../components/session.md).

## Scene Duration Estimation

The first time you use the `Scene Analyser`, it will use pre-default duration for each [scene](../components/scene.md),
but the more you use the `Scene Analyser`, the more it will base the estimation on the real duration of every
scene type for a specific [campaign](../components/campaign.md).

In order to use your personal [scenes](../components/scene.md) duration, RPG Manager has the ability to track
the duration of each [scene](../components/scene.md) when you run them. A handy button can start and stop
a timer every time you run a [scene](../components/scene.md). This information will make the `Scene Analyser`
your personal approach to each [scene type](scenetypes.md) for a specific [campaign](../components/campaign.md).

## Results

The `Scene Analyser` will analyse your [acts](../components/act.md) or [sessions](../components/session.md) based on
the [scenes](../components/scene.md) they contain and will provide you a real time report (_updated every time you
change any detail in one of its [scenes](../components/scene.md)_) with a percentage-based quality score.

The quality score will be complemented by a list of suggestions.

## Pro and Con

The main _con_ of the `Scene Analyser` is the fact that, in order to run properly, it requries a structured approach
to how you build your [scenes](../components/scene.md). While this may be tedious in the beginning, once it
becomes a habit, it will help you creating [acts](../components/act.md) and [sessions](../components/session.md)
that are more balanced and more fun to play!
