ABT Structure

# ABT Structure

The ABT story structure is a way of telling a story in four simple parts:

- a need
- (**A**nd) the first attempt to fulfil the need
- (**B**ut) a challenge
- (**T**herefore) a resolution

> I need something
>
> **AND** I try to get it
>
> **BUT** there is an unexpected issue in the process
>
> **THEREFORE** I need to change the way I am to fulfil my need

This wave of need/try/fail/succeed is the perfect structure to keep high the interest in your players.

> **Example of an ABT Adventure Plot**
>
> After arriving on Tatooine in search for a Jedi Master who is rumoured to hide in the desolate planet, Kith-shan 
> sees her contact being killed in front of her eyes.
>
> **AND** decides to investigate the reasons behind the murder
>
> **BUT** when she finds the Tusken Raider who killed her, she realises her connection with the Force has weakened
>
> **THEREFORE** she fights the Tusken Raider without the Force and learns that the rumours are true: there is a Force
> User in the Dune Sea of Tatooine.


In the short example above, you can see that there is tension. The Jedi Padawan needs something (talking to an old 
contact, finding a master, understanding why her contact was killed) and goes through some hurdles to get to something 
tangible. But she fails in the middle, there is a moment of despair when she can't use the Force as she was used to, 
but she resorts to changing her life, and is rewarded with the thing she dreams the most: finding a Jedi Master.

Where do I use the ABT structure? I use it to draft my initial campaign plot, each adventure structure and each session 
structure. The goal is to simplify the creation of a story in a few lines. The challenge is to learn to do it in such
a way you give yourself ample space to expand your structure to contain interesting things for the player characters 
to do.
