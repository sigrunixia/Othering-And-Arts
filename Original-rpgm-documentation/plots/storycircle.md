Story Circle Structure

# Story Circle Structure

The story circle is a distillation of The hero of a Thousand Faces story structure. Instead of 17 complicated steps, 
the story circle divides each story in eight points, divided in 4 simple groups. I have adapted the typical story 
circle to work well in plotting a tabletop role playing game.

1. **You**: An introduction to the player character's normal life.
2. **Need**: Make the player characters feel the need to do something, to embark in the adventure.
3. **Go**: Decide to go and move the first steps to fulfil their need.
4. **Search**: Overcome the odds (*the path of trials*)
5. **Find**: Find what the player characters were looking for...
6. **Take**: ///but make them pay a huge price for it and give them a different goal
7. **Return**: Make the player characters decide to stop moaning and reach for the stars. They come back to the 
world they know
8. **Change**: And they change themselves, therefore changing the world they know (*aka, they succeed*)

The Story Circle is, first and foremost a circle. Every story is the continuation of the previous one and changes the 
player characters for the next one.

The eight steps are grouped in four different stages:

1. **Introduction**: (*You* + *Need*) the player characters feel the need to follow your plot.
2. **First Attempt**: (*Go* + *Search*) AND they try to fulfil their needs.
3. **Failure**: (*Find* + *Take*) BUT they fail, in a way, and realise the real fulfilment comes from something else
4. **Success**: (*Return* + *Change*) THEREFORE they overcome the challenge and become new characters through their 
experience

As you can see the groups of the story circle are practically the same as the four steps of the [ABT](abt.md) method. 
This is why I use both: I start with the [ABT](abt.md) and then I detail it with the Story Circle.

> **Example of a Story Circle Adventure Plot**
> **You**: Kith-shan arrives on Tatooine looking or a Jedi Master who is
	rumoured to be on the planet. and if I write something long?
> 
> **Need**: She must speak to her contact, but she witness her murdered by a Tusken Raider and gets the impression 
> the Raider was waiting for her to arrive before killing her contact. She feels that her only hope of finding the 
> Jedi Master is running away.
> 
> **Go**: Kith-shan starts running behind the Raider and dodges a few groups of Stormtroopers
> 
> **Search**: She manage to see that the Tusken Raider is moving towards a specific part of the Dune Sea and recovers 
> something they dropped by mistake: parts of a lightsaber.
> 
> **Find**: Kith-shan finds the Tusken Raiders' camp and realises that they have Jedi relics, but realises her 
> connection with the Force is much weaker than she thought.
> 
> **Take**: She identifies the killer, but fails to acquire any additional knowledge about the rumoured Jedi Master. 
> At the lowest point, tired and dehydrated, she receives a vision of her old Master, who tells her that patience 
> and perseverance wins over every hurdle.
> 
> **Return**: Kith-shan, sees the killer moving away from the camp, and manages to fight and defeat him.
> 
> **Change**: She finds a holo message in the Raider's pocket of a shadowy figure that tells them Kith-shan was coming 
> on Tatooine, ordering them to kill her and make her disappear in the Dune Sea before investigating the rumours of a 
> Jedi in a specific part of the Dune Sea.

As you can see, the Story Circle allows me to go much more in the adventure's details. Yet, when I write it, I always 
start from its simplified version: the [ABT](abt.md) writing structure.
