# Music Component

A `music` is a specific song or playlist that is relevant for a specific moment in a [Campaign](Campaign.md). A `music`  
is generally linked to a specific [Scene](Scene.md).

`Music components` can contain other `music` as children. So a `music` can identify a playlist, with its children  
identifying a specific song.
