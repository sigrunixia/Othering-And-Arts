Components

# Types of Components

RPG Manager uses 12 different types of `component`. Some of them are used to plot a campaign, some are used to run it, and the others are the elements of your campaign.

## Plotting Components

One of the key element in plotting a campaign is how it is split in hierarchical plot elements. RPG Manager uses a specific [Hierarchy](Hierarchy.md). This hierarchy is fixed and can't be changed, as it forms the backbone of the plot.

| Plot                      | Description                                                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Campaign](Campaign.md)   | The overarching plot of the story                                         |
| [Adventure](Adventure.md) | A self contained story arc focusing on the player characters              |
| [Act](Act.md)             | The part of a story that is centred on a specific moment in an adventure  |
| [Scene](Scene.md)         | A short encounter, or a location, that the player characters play         |

## Running Components

| Element               | Descripton                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Session](Session.md) | An `real life` game session, used to group together multiple plotted `scenes` |

## Element Components

| Element                                         | Descripton                                                           |

| [Clue](Clue.md)                                 | An item that can provide information to the player characters        |
| [Faction](Faction.md)                           | A group of characters                                                |
| [Location](Location.md)                         | A place in your world                                                |
