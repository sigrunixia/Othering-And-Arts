# Scene Excitement

The `Scene Excitement` is a flag that mark a [scene](../components/scene.md) as containing exciting elements.  
In particular, the [Scene Analyser](0-index.md) consider exciting a [scene](../components/scene.md) that contains  
an action or a new information coming from an external source as a  
[non-player character](../components/non-player-character.md).

This is as simple as it gets: a [scene](../components/scene.md) is `exciting` when an element external from the  
[player characters](../components/character.md) arrive at them without being expected
