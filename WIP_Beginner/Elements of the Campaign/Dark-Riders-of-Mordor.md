> *The Skeletal Cryomancer casts a scornful gaze at nine riders, frozen in blocks of ice and time. "Awaken, otiose drongos! We have use for you." As the ice begins to crack, he snaps a finger nine times. Each snap produces an icicle that hovers nearby. "Follow the shards. It will lead you to your quarry, whom wears a most unique bijou on their finger."*

> *The uniform shrieks of rage shattered the ice.*

## What is a Faction?

A faction is a group of player characters and/or non-player characters. They can be as small as a "Party", and as large as a "Corporation." A faction normally has an overarching goal.

## Creating the Black Riders of Mordor

Using the RPG-Manager die-initiated menu, or the command palette, go ahead and **Create** or **Fill a New Faction**.

We're going to name ours the **`Black Riders`**.

> *You may notice we are now using Black-Riders due to a naming convention needed as this vault will be also hosted on Github. You can use spaces freely.*
