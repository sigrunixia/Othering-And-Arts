## What is a location?

A location is a place in the campaign the Player-Characters (PC) or Non-Player Characters (NPC) are living in. RPG Manager (RPGM) does not discriminate  or require a specific size, as it can be as big as a country, or as small as a drawer.

Locations are where characters will live their stories, and while not all may be worth creating in RPGM (That is alll up to you!) , but those with more interest, or the ones that are recurring, we highly recommend creating.
