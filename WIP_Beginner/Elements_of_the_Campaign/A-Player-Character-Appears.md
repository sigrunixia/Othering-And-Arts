Welcome to the Elements of a Campaign. Unlike the [**Archives of the Hierarchy**](../Building_the_Campaign/Archives-of-the-Hierarchy.md), we're going to dive on in and explain how to build each Element as much of the existing knowledge you have gained applies here as well.

## What is a Player Character?

## Creating Samwise Gamgee

You know what to do. Let's go to the normal RPG-Manager menu and choose **`Create a Character`**. If you have an existing Character file you want to use RPG Manager with, choose **`Fill with Character`** instead.

- You will be asked to create a title. We are using **`Samwise Gamgee`**

- You can skip the template for now.

- Pick the Campaign you want this Act to be created in. We are using **`0 Lord of the Rings`**.

#### Goals

Certain Elements contain Goals, which allow you to help keep track of the motivations of your character. What are some things they want to accomplish? 

For Samwise Gamgee, we know he is a Gardener and loves Potatoes, so we're going to make one of his goals be: **`Grow the biggest Potato in the history of The Shire.`** Now we're going to add some more. 

**`Meet a Tree-Man.`**

**`Marry Rosie.`**

**`Keep Mr. Frodo out of trouble.`**

**`Not necessarily in that order.`**
