Event

# Event Component

An `event` is something that happened (or will happen) during a [Campaign](Campaign.md), in which the player
characters are not directly involved. The main difference with a [Scene](Scene.md) is that the latter is designed
to involve the player characters.

`Events` are _generally_ related to [clues](clues.md), [locations](Location.md), [factions](Faction.md) and 
[non-player characters](Non-Player-Character.md).

The `events` are mainly part of world building, to give context to the story, and to provide information to the 
player characters.


RPG Manger offers a way of organising `events` through its [subplot components](Subplot.md)
