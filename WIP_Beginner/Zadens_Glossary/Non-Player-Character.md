## Non-Player Character Component

A `non-player character` is a character which is managed and played by the Storyteller. They are, by far, the
most important `components` in a [Campaign](Campaign.md), as they are one of the most important ways of moving the 
story forward.

Ever `non-player character` should have goals, which helps the Storyteller to make them act consistently.
