# On WOTC, and Why Compromise Is Not The Call

Soâ€¦ there is a cultural phenomena that has played out for many, many, many generations. Millennia. Children surpass and oppress their parents. Has happened in race, has happened in older economic systems, religions. The new paints the old as uncivilized and primitive, outdated. Persecutes them, sometimes even extinguishes them. In many ways its inevitable, just as in many ways its not handled in ways deemed morally right, but it can be inevitable and ethical if work is put into the process.

The current economic system, officially and culturally, turns this occurrence on its head and promotes an "eat the children" mindset. Children eaters will not be able to understand the concerns or interests of Parent Slayers, and vice versa. Any compromises between the two are spices being put on the side of a plate, or the sharpening of weapons waiting to be used. Their motivations are different. Outlook is different.

The one benefit in all of this is we are human and not completely controlled by instincts and so this can change, but it takes everyone else doing the hard thing and saying "No more."

You find common ground with friends, but enemies have already determined you have something they want, or you are an obstacle. Appeasement as a strategy might lead to slavery, if lucky.
