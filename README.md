Currently WIP for Documentation and Test Vault for [Obsidian RPG Manager](https://github.com/carlonicora/obsidian-rpg-manager), because a branch is not big enough for this!

In the future, it'll be something else. 


## Legal Disclaimer

The guide to utilizing RPG Manager and the associated test vault utilizes the worldbuilding and story of The Lord of the Rings, created by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien who is more commonly known as J.R.R. Tolkien, and Christopher Tolkien. This story was chosen not only due it having such an impact on the creation of table-top roleplaying games, but due to it being so recognizable thanks to Peter Jackson's adaptation, that its use as an educational tool would be effective to our multicultural plugin base. Furthermore, RPG Manager, and its contributers do not collect any funds towards the management of this plugin, nor this guide. As such, we are claiming a fair use of this material under [17 U.S. Code ยง 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). We do this with the understanding that the bare minimum of direct content is to be used, and only when necessary. 


All rights to the story, the characters, the world, elements, and any other attributing figures created by the Tolkiens, remain with the Tolkiens and their Estate as well as Harper Collins Publishing. Media and merchandizing rights for the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit were recently purchased by Embracer Group, however it is under contention with Warner Brothers and the Saul Zaentz Co., which is a long winded way of saying that none of us on this Github own those rights or intend to take those rights.
